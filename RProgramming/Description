The goal of these R programmes is to analyze the characteristics of the 
most streamed songs on Spotify in 2023. By examining various attributes 
of these songs, such as beats per minute (BPM), danceability, acousticness, 
appearance in Apple charts, and the key they are in, the study aims to 
identify patterns and relationships that might explain their popularity.

We expect to find significant relationships between different musical 
attributes and the popularity of songs, measured by the number of streams. 
Specifically, we anticipate that the average BPM of popular songs might be 
higher than a certain threshold.

Additionally, there might be a correlation between the danceability and 
acousticness of songs. We also hypothesize that the appearance of a song 
in the Apple charts could be a predictor of the number of streams it receives.

Finally, we expect that the key of a song might influence its average 
number of streams. This analysis could provide valuable insights into 
what makes a song popular on a major streaming platform like Spotify.
