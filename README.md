Project 1: Integration of AI Services and Tools in Education at UTM

  The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in educational settings has become increasingly common, offering significant opportunities to enhance students' learning experiences. In the era of digital transformation, it's crucial to understand how AI impacts educational methods, particularly within the Faculty of Computing at the University of Technology Malaysia (UTM). AI-driven technologies, such as intelligent tutoring systems, personalized learning platforms, and automated grading systems, provide students with customized and dynamic educational experiences. This project aims to investigate how students within the Faculty of Computing at UTM utilize AI services and tools to support their learning. By conducting a comprehensive questionnaire-based survey, the study will explore prevailing attitudes towards these technologies and their impact on academic performance and engagement. The goal is to uncover the effectiveness and implications of AI integration in creating a more enriched and efficient learning environment at UTM.

Project 2: Analysis of Most Streamed Songs on Spotify in 2023

  This study analyzes the characteristics of the most streamed songs on Spotify in 2023. By examining attributes such as beats per minute (BPM), danceability, acousticness, appearance in Apple charts, and key, the study aims to identify patterns and relationships that might explain their popularity. The analysis seeks to provide insights into what makes a song popular on a major streaming platform like Spotify. The study hypothesizes that there will be significant relationships between different musical attributes and the popularity of songs, measured by the number of streams. Specifically, it anticipates that the average BPM of popular songs might be higher than a certain threshold, and that there might be a correlation between danceability and acousticness. The appearance of a song in the Apple charts could also predict the number of streams it receives. Finally, the study expects that the key of a song might influence its average number of streams.
